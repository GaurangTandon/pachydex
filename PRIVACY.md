## Privacy Policy for Pachydex

### Data transmitted

All the data generated or collected by Pachydex is stored on the user's own device. No data is transmitted to or downloaded from any first-party or third-party service. All the extension code runs fully locally on the user's device.

### Data collected and generated

For every webpage the user visits, Pachydex automatically reads the text content of it and also takes a screenshot of it. Pachydex then generates a summary for what the user has read or seen. Pachydex allows the user to search upon this data by specifying keywords so the user can easily find what they are looking for.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will communicate changes to the policy here in advance.
