# Pachydex üêò

**Your AI-Powered Memory Vault** - Like an elephant, Pachydex never forgets what you've read. If you read lots of articles or watch lots of videos on the internet, and want to semantically search from any past article or video, this Chrome extension is for you.

**Diverse set of use cases:**

1. **Students** writing a research paper can quickly find articles they've read that support your claims.
2. **Professionals** learning new topics can quickly revisit tutorials they watched months ago.
3. **Engineers** making architectural decisions can find that technical article comparing different approaches they researched months ago.
4. **Personal users** making a purchasing decision can quickly check those product reviews articles they read weeks ago, or recall the name of the Indian dish they saw last week.
5. **Writers** can research topics and find inspiration by pulling up all relevant articles they've read previously.

and so on...

**User facing features**

1. Automatic indexing of RELEVANT content from ALL articles or videos on the web (without any user interaction)
2. 100% on-device processing ensures complete privacy.
3. Smart AI based classification and content handling ignores irrelevant text from the web, such as invisible elements, captcha blockers, cookie popups, redirects, etc.
4. Smart AI embeddings based search is robust even with 10K+ count of entries (when you read ten articles per day for several years).

**Technical features**

1. Uses Chrome Built in AI model (Gemini v3Nano) for classification and summarization

## Overall extension flow

### Indexing the web (no user interaction)

1. On every page load, the extension automatically extracts the text content of the webpage, and filters out the parts that are (1) not visible to the user (hidden dialogs or captcha popups) or (2) not relevant to the AI (navbar, buttons, etc.). The document is then converted into Markdown.
2. The extension also takes a screenshot of the page.
3. The extension sends both the text and the screenshot to **Gemini Nano** (Chrome Built-in AI) to decide if the page hosts a clearly visible article or video and that it is not a confidential page.
   - Examples of webpages matching both the criteria: a Wikipedia article on geography, a blog post about Python, a single CNN news piece
   - Examples of webpages not matching the first criteria: the homepage of New York Times, Google Search results page, telephone directory pages, HN frontpage
   - Examples of webpages not matching the second criteria: personal bank account page or personal gmail inbox
4. If the page satisfies both criteria, and has not already been blocklisted by the user, the extension reuses **Gemini Nano** to generate tags and takeaways for the given page.
5. These are then stored in an IndexedDB.
6. There is a separate, routine job that runs every few minutes to generate vector embeddings for all the new entries in the IndexedDB.

### Searching the database (active user interaction)

1. On the options page, the user can initiate a search based on a query.
2. The extension uses EmbeddingGemma (the 8-bit quantised version of the 300M parameter model) to generate embeddings for the query, which are obtained in a Float32Array with 768 values.
3. The extension obtains cosine similarity score of the query embedding against all the pre-computed document embeddings (also using EmbeddingGemma), and returns sorted results based on the score (descending sort).

## Notes on real world usage

1. Taking a reasonably high assumption of 20 article reads per day for 365 days of the year, we end up with ~7000 entries in one year, which takes up XX MB amount of space on disk. I tested search on this and it took ??ms to return relevant results.
1. The zip file for the extension is less than 300MB which is well within the limit for a [maximum Chrome extension size (2GB)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish)

## Future goals

1. Stats section to show how much you've read every week or month
